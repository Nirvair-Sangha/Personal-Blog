# Personal-Blog
This is a Personal Blog I created to talk about simple events going on in my life and other projects I am working on. 
I created the backend of the blog using the Django framework in Python which includes features like comments, user authentication, publishing drafts to the blog, and editing older posts.
I also used HTML to create the templates the blog uses for comments, posts, and the site as a whole with some CSS styling with bootstrap to make it look nicer and give it some color appeal.
I deployed it to a live domain using pythonanywhere and you can check out the blog and leave a comment at https://nicksangha.pythonanywhere.com.
